         <li><h2>What is JavaScript?</h2></li>
         <ul>
           <li><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</li>
           
           <li>A company called Netscape was founded in 1994 which created one of the first web browser. They recruited Eich in 1995 because they wanted him to create a programming laguage for that web browser.
           JavaScript was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, who co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla Corporation, he served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical officer and briefly its chief executive officer. JavaScript was not known as JS, the Original name was <strong>MOCHA</strong> a name chosen by MARC ANDREESSEN founder of NETSCAPE.</li>
           <li>In September 1995, the name was changed to LiveScript and in December same year, upon receiving trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. This was because the market move at that time with Java was being very popular around then.</li>
         
           <li>Eich explained why Netscape thought two languages were needed, instead of just Java, and why JavaScript is embedded in HTML.<br>
           <em>We aimed to provide a “glue language” for the Web designers and part time programmers who were building Web content from components such as images, plugins, and Java applets. We saw Java as the “component language” used by higher-priced programmers, where the glue programmers – the Web page designers – would assemble components and automate their interactions using JS</em>.</li>
</p>      </ul>
           <li><h2>What is JavaScript mainly used for?</h2></li>
           <ul>
           	<li>Javascript, client-side scripting language. Primarily used for UI enhancement and adding dynamic elements to webpages. It can also be used to implement AJAX, which can communicate with your server without refreshing your page. Java script is mainly used in client side scripting.</li>
           	<li>JavaScript is very easy to implement. All you need to do is put your code in the HTML document and tell the browser that it is JavaScript.</li>
           	<li>JavaScript allows you to create highly responsive interfaces that improve the user experience and provide dynamic functionality, without having to wait for the server to react and show another page.</li>
           	<li>JavaScript can help fix browser problems or patch holes in browser support — for example fixing CSS layout issues in certain browsers.</li>
           </ul>
           <li><h2>Example of Code in JavaScript</h2></li>
           <ul>
           	<li><pre>
           	           <script type="text/javascript">
                           script contents go here
                      </script>
                </pre></li>
           </ul>
